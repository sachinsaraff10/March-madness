March-madness simulator:

This is a simulator for every possible matchup of both the men's and women's 2025 march-madness tournaments. For dataset preperation, I used the code at https://www.kaggle.com/code/robikscube/machine-learning-bracket-gpu-powered as a template. I used https://www.kaggle.com/code/sachinsaraff/simulate-n-brackets to generate the simulations.
